cites

significance

Interestingly,
in
the
late
1950s,
before
the
structure
of
DNA
was
well-understood,
Seymour
Benzer
was
able
to
show
that
the
intersection
graph
of
a
large
number
of
fragments
of
genetic
material
was
an
interval
graph
\cite
{sb59}.
This
was
regarded
as
compelling
evidence
that
genetic
information
was
somehow
arranged
inside
a
structure
that
had
a
linear
topology
which
we
now
know
to
be
true\tnote
